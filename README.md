## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

The memory game is a card-match game. Every time the game loads, the cards are shuffled. On clicking the first card,
a timer starts up and keeps track of the time taken. If two consecutive clicks yield matching cards, then those cards are kept open.
On matching all of the 8 sets of cards, a message pops up showing the time taken, rating of the player, and the moves taken to finish
the game. A reset button is also provided to restart the game.
